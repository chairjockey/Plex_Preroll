# Plex_Preroll

My bash script in my User-Scripts for Unraid used to monthly update Plex 'Preferences.xml' to add videos to list for preolls based on the current month.

I have my Plex prerolls setup within month folders. i.e December is for Christmas prerolls, October is for Halloween prerolls. 

If in a month without a preroll folder, it will go to a 'default' folder of the standard prerolls.

You don't have to update anyfiles, it will generate a list of all .mp4 files within a folder, add that to the 'Preferences.xml' for the prerolls and then restart the plex service.

It only generates the list for a randomly choosen preroll (;). When semi-colons are used, a single pre-roll video will be chosen randomly from the list. 
It does not use (,). If commas are entered, videos will be played sequentially.
